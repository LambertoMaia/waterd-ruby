# Water Displacement Calculator
This is a old project I had from a previous work. It calculates the water displacement of an object. Used to check the buoyancy of an object and the mass of displaced fluid.


# How it works?
By using the formula `B = p x V x g`,  Where `B` is the Buoyant force `p` is the density of the liquid the object is immersed in (in kg/m³), `V` is the Volume of displaced liquid (in kg/m³) and `g` is the gravitational acceleration in m/s². We can calculate the Buoyant force.

Using the formula `W = p x V ` we can calculate for weight of the displaced liquid.

# Why Ruby?
Even though you can achieve this with any other language or even by using a calculator, I tought it would be fun to make something more automated and simple on a language that I had no previous knowledge. 

It makes for a good challenge and I learned some interesting stuff while making this project.
